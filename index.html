            <h3>More Information</h3>
            <p>I am deeply passionate about coding, finding joy in unraveling the intricacies of programming
                languages,
                and embarking on a journey of creation through each line of code. Beyond the digital realm, another love of
                mine
                is basketball, where the court becomes my canvas for expression. Playing basketball is more than just a
                physical
                activity; it's a source of excitement and a platform for honing skills such as teamwork, strategy, and
                perseverance.</p>
