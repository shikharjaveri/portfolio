    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>My name is Shikhar Javeri,I am 19 years old I am currently
            pursuing a Btech incomputer science in VIT Vellore.I enjoy playing sports I play basketball and football.I
            also enjoy playing
            music.I am deeply passionate about coding, finding joy in unraveling the intricacies of programming
            languages,
            and embarking on a journey of creation through each line of code. Beyond the digital realm, another love of
            mine
            is basketball, where the court becomes my canvas for expression. Playing basketball is more than just a
            physical
            activity; it's a source of excitement and a platform for honing skills such as teamwork, strategy, and
            perseverance.
            Much like the vibrant emotions depicted in artwork, my experiences on the basketball court are a dynamic
            exploration of athleticism and camaraderie. Each game is a unique blend of strategy and skill, where I not
            only
            aim for victory but also relish the shared moments and connections formed with teammates. Just as
            brushstrokes
            convey emotions in art, every dribble and shot in basketball becomes a way for me to express my enthusiasm
            and
            determination.
